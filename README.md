# SuperHi: Foundation HTML, CSS + JavaScript

## What this is - 15 Feb 2023

Hello!

The [SuperHi Foundation HTML, CSS + JavaScript course](https://www.superhi.com/courses/html-css-javascript-foundation) was, outside of a "Programming for Non-Programmers" weekend course with General Assembly, the first course I started on after leaving full-time beer marketing back in Autumn 2020. It wasn't the first course I finished, however! ðŸ˜… After learning Python with [Code First Girls](https://codefirstgirls.com//) at the end of 2021, I didn't wind up completing the course until Autumn 2022 due to various reasons, but complete it I did!

Apart from the homework. ðŸ˜… But that'll be another project to come!

I have also completed SuperHi's [JavaScript for Designers](https://www.superhi.com/courses/javascript-for-designers) course, which you can also find listed in my repos. My first SuperHi course I ever started, their [Visual Design + Branding](https://www.superhi.com/courses/visual-design-and-branding) one, remains incomplete for now in favour of becoming more familiar with JavaScript currently. However, I love design and I intend to complete it at a later date.

I previously had these projects in my GitHub, but they were copy/pasted into Atom directly from the SuperHi Editor, so they didn't render properly. ðŸ˜“ Also, each chapter/project had its own GitHub repository.

I've taken those down and am now putting them back up all in one repository, which will be good reference for me going forward, and, as it's been a while since I completed this course, it's also a nice review to look at them while I've been uploading them and thinking: How can I improve this? How can I flesh this out?

This repo will eventually have somewhere in-between 8 and 10 "weeks" of projects, with a couple being either updated versions of previous projects. If you are very new to coding and are looking to do frontend stuff, feel free to earmark this repo as a reference if you think it might be useful.
