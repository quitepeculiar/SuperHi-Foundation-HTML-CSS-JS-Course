### SuperHi: Foundation HTML, CSS + JavaScript

# Chapter 4: Boyce (with CSS Flexbox)

This project uses the CSS `display: flex` property, in contrast with the other Boyce project in this repo, which uses the `float` property.

One of my criticisms of SuperHi is that their Foundation videos did not seem very current when I was working through the course towards the end of 2020 through 2022, as the instructor, for one example, used `var` in JavaScript code, which is now largely frowned upon unless you are working with legacy code.

I've kept both the Float and Flex versions of this code, as I thought it would be great to compare the code between the two. I suppose the other option is to make the same website but using CSS Grid, perhaps!

This version of the website also has the _List_ link working!
