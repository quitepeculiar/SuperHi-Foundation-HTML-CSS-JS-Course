### SuperHi: Foundation HTML, CSS + JavaScript

# Chapter 4: Boyce (with CSS Floats)

This project uses the CSS `float` property, which has fallen out of favour with developers who now prefer either Grid or Flexbox for layouts.

One of my criticisms of SuperHi is that their Foundation videos did not seem very current when I was working through the course towards the end of 2020 through 2022, as the instructor, for one example, used `var` in JavaScript code, which is now largely frowned upon unless you are working with legacy code.

I've kept this version and have also a version that uses Flexbox that the course did teach us. I thought it would be great to compare the code between the two, so I have them in two separate folders.
