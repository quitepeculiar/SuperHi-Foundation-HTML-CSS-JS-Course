### SuperHi: Foundation HTML, CSS + JavaScript

# Chapter 8: Sally Hart Lightbox

At some point in between when I initially downloaded all the SuperHi assets from each course back in 2020, to when I went back to complete the course in 2022, another chapter was snuck in: either this one or the previous project for Interior Weekly.

In any case, this is the Sally Hart project "remixed" with lightbox and modals as opposed to the parallax site from the first week.

Honestly, I prefer the first one to this one. ðŸ˜¹ I don't think I like lightboxes very much. Maybe they've been overused since this video was made, but I find them a bit boring.
