### SuperHi: Foundation HTML, CSS + JavaScript

# Chapter 7: Interior Weekly

Per the SuperHi website: _In this chapter, we use Javascript to create interactive effects based on how far the user has scrolled. We also define conditional logic using if/else statements and math._

The interactive effects include changing the background colour and to have the header hide on scroll.

One of the things about taking this course is that the instructor in the video uses `var` as opposed to `const` or `let` which may not have actually been in use or in wide useage when the video was recorded! Judging by the copyright dates we wrote on other projects, the video may have been recorded back in 2016 or 2017.

In this project, I actually kept `var` for one of the variables in the `scroll.js` file because of this, but I did switch to `const` for other variables in the file.
