### SuperHi: Foundation HTML, CSS + JavaScript

# Chapter 3: Furneauxs

This website project had us create a multi-column website for a flower shop.

This, as with the next project, uses the CSS `float` property, which has fallen out of favour with developers who now prefer either Grid or Flexbox for layouts. One of my criticisms of SuperHi is that their Foundation videos did not seem very current when I was working through the course towards the end of 2020 through 2022, as the instructor, for one example, used `var` in JavaScript code, which is now largely frowned upon unless you are working with legacy code.

That aside, it would be fun to remake this website using Flexbox, which is exactly what will be done in the next project, Boyce.
