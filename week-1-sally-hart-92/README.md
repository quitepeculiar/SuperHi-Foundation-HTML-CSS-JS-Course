## SuperHi: Foundation HTML, CSS + JavaScript

# Chapter 1: Sally Hart

This is a simple website showcasing HTML and CSS and using the parallax effect. This is the first project on SuperHi's Foundation course.

I previously had these projects in my GitHub, but they were copy/pasted into Atom directly from the SuperHi Editor, so they didn't render properly. ðŸ˜“ Also, each chapter/project had its own GitHub repository.

I've taken those down and am now putting them back up all in one repository, which will be good reference for me going forward, and, as it's been a while since I completed this course, it's also a nice review as well.
