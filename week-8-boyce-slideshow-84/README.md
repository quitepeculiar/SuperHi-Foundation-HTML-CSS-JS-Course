# Chapter 9: Boyce Slideshow

We took the assets from the earlier Boyce Project and put together a full-page slideshow that can change slides automatically without user input.

One of the things about taking this course is that the instructor in the video uses `var` as opposed to `const` or `let` which may not have actually been in use or in wide useage when the video was recorded! Judging by the copyright dates we wrote on other projects, the video may have been recorded back in 2016 or 2017.

In this project, I have used `let` a lot probably where `const` was more appropriate in the slideshow file, as opposed to using `var` as per the lesson. I've left it for now (15 Feb 2023) but I may revisit it to update the JavaScript to be more modern in the future.

And that's the last of the project in this series! Well, apart from the homework I mentioned elsewhere! ðŸ˜…
