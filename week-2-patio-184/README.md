### SuperHi: Foundation HTML, CSS + JavaScript

# Chapter 2: Patio

This is a static front page for a nonexistant business in London.

It was put together with basic HTML and CSS to showcase a single-column website and to use media queries in order to make it responsive.

I previously had these projects in my GitHub, but they were copy/pasted into Atom directly from the SuperHi Editor, so they didn't render properly. ðŸ˜“ Also, each chapter/project had its own GitHub repository.

I've taken those down and am now putting them back up all in one repository, which will be good reference for me going forward, and, as it's been a while since I completed this course, it's also a nice review as well.
