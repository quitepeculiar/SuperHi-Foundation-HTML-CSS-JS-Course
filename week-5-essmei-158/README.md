### SuperHi: Foundation HTML, CSS + JavaScript

# Chapter 5: Essmei

For this project, we use a Javascript library called jQuery to create a responsive shop website (that really is only selling just one product, am I right here?) that has a filtering menu and a toggling feature on mobile devices.

I renamed the jQuery file for whatever reason. ðŸ˜… I've kept it as is, but there really wasn't a need for me to have renamed it.

This project was the first one on the SuperHi Foundation course in which we waded into JavaScript. More to come!
