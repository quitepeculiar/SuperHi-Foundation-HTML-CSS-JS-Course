### SuperHi: Foundation HTML, CSS + JavaScript

# Chapter 6: Baker + Brown

For this project, we play with hover transitions, transformations, and a menu that toggles open and closed with jQuery. This was also the chapter in which we learned about absolute and relative positioning in CSS.

This was a fun project to do, and the menu toggling was super useful. Stylelistically, I would never want this much going on in such a small space on a website, though. ðŸ˜¹
